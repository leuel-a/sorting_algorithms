<h1>C - Sorting algorithms & Big O</h1>

<h2>Big O Notation</h2>
<p>Big Oh notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.
A method of solving problems is called an <b>algorithm</b>. BigOh (in its simplest form)
 reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen
 based on observations or assumptions.</p>

<p>Big O Notation gives the upper-bound runtime or worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
 It analyzes and classifies algorithms depending on their run time or space requirements.

Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run when the input tends
 towards a specific or limiting value. It calculates the time taken to execute each code 
statement in an algorithm.

Big O Notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates 
the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words, it calculates the 
worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. 

Big O Notation in Data Structure describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime. It 
calculates the time and amount of memory needed to execute the algorithm for an input value.</p>
